# The SDCF: Semi-automatically structured Dataset of Citation Functions #

This repository stores an official dataset of citation functions of the paper, SDCF: Semi-automatically structured Dataset of Citation Functions. 

The developed datasets consist of two parts: 
1. Development dataset, manually labeled and is used for building the annotation scheme of citation functions.
2. Final dataset, which is built automatically based on the best models on the development stages.

## Labeling scheme of citation functions ## 
The proposed scheme consists of two parts, five coarse labels and 21 fine-grained labels.

## Dataset Evaluation ##
